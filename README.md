# Description

Detects newly installed applications in your Intune environment by using the Discovered apps list that's generated by the Intune Management Extension. It works by exporting a list of all detected apps from Intune to a CSV and diffing the current day's export against one n days in the past. Results are sent to the email address configured during deployment.

I created this tool to satisfy the CIS 18 control 2.4 "Utilize Automated Software Inventory Tools" by regularly alerting the administrator to apps that are being added to the environment.


# Usage

Run deploy.ps1 to deploy the app to an Azure Function App that executes every day at 1500 UTC. You will be prompted for configuration variables during script execution.
